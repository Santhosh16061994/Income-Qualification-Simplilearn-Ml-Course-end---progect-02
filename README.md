# Income Qualification for Latin American Families

This project aims to identify the level of income qualification needed for families in Latin America. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify families into income categories based on various socio-economic features. By doing so, we can gain insights into the income distribution and help organizations and policymakers address the specific needs of different income groups.

DESCRIPTION

Identify the level of income qualification needed for the families in Latin America.

### Problem Statement Scenario:
Many social programs have a hard time ensuring that the right people are given enough aid. It’s tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of the population can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.

In Latin America, a popular method called Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to
classify them and predict their level of need.

While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT’s performance.
Following actions should be performed:

Identify the output variable.
Understand the type of data.
Check if there are any biases in your dataset.
Check whether all members of the house have the same poverty level.
Check if there is a house without a family head.
Set poverty level of the members and the head of the house within a family.
Count how many null values are existing in columns.
Remove null value rows of the target variable.
Predict the accuracy using random forest classifier.
Check the accuracy using random forest with cross validation.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about families in Latin America, including socio-economic characteristics and the corresponding income qualification. It includes features such as education level, employment status, family size, demographics, and other relevant attributes. The dataset will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Approach

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features as necessary. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract additional relevant information.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A thorough analysis of the dataset will be conducted to understand the relationships between features and income qualification. This analysis will involve visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis to gain insights into the data.

3. **Model Development**: Various machine learning algorithms will be employed to train classification models. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines may be used, and their hyperparameters will be tuned to optimize performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of different models will be compared to select the best-performing one.

5. **Deployment**: The selected model will be deployed, allowing users to input relevant socio-economic features of a family and obtain the predicted income qualification category. This will facilitate decision-making processes for organizations, policymakers, and social programs.

## Dependencies

The project will utilize popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling. The code will be written in Python and will be made available in the GitHub repository along with detailed instructions for reproducibility.

## Conclusion

By developing a machine learning model that accurately predicts the income qualification of families in Latin America, this project aims to provide valuable insights for social programs, policymakers, and organizations working towards addressing income disparities. The model will help identify and understand income levels in different households, enabling the implementation of targeted strategies to improve the well-being and livelihoods of families across the region.
